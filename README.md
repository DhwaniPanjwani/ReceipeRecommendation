Receipe Recommendation System
Abstract: 
Eating healthy food is essential to maintain a functioning body and mind. At CMU, it is often 
seen that graduate students, on average, lose a considerable amount of weight during the course 
of their studies. It is almost always attributed to a lack of knowledge about cooking food and the 
ingredients required to make healthy food. InstaFood is an application that suggests new and 
easy-to-implement recipes to make healthy and delicious meals. It also provides essential calorie 
and health information for health-conscious folks so they can focus on learning and building 
exciting stuff while at CMU without having to worry about their meal.
